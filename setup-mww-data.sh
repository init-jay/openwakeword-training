# Download the microWakeWord ambient negative sets. ~5.7 GB.
#
# THIS DELIBERATELY DOWNLOADS NOTHING ELSE. mWW's augmentation wants impulse
# responses and background audio, and those are the SAME three corpora setup-data.sh
# already fetched for openWakeWord - MIT RIRs, AudioSet and FMA, from the same URLs.
# mww/config.py points `impulse_paths` and `background_paths` at them in place.
# Re-fetching would cost another ~10 GB for identical bytes.
#
# What is genuinely new is the ambient negative sets. They are pre-computed
# RaggedMmap spectrograms in microWakeWord's own feature format, so unlike the audio
# corpora they cannot be shared with the openWakeWord side, and unlike this repo's
# adversarial negatives they are large and general - they are what teaches the model
# that ordinary rooms, music and conversation are not the wake word.
#
# They also carry mWW's primary metric. Its model selection minimises false accepts
# per hour on ambient audio before maximising recall, and testing_ambient /
# validation_ambient are what that is measured on.
#
# Idempotent: each set is skipped if already unpacked.
