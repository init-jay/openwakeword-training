"""
Score a trained wake-word model against the four gates in tuning.md.

Everything here is measured by streaming - `Model.predict_clip` slides the model
over the clip 80 ms at a time, exactly as live detection does - because that is
what the gates are about. `eval/check_model_alignment.py` answers a different question
(where in the window the model wants the phrase) by placing clips at fixed offsets;
a clip that misses at one offset may well fire at the next one in streaming, so the
two scripts are not interchangeable.

Gates (from tuning.md):

    extend + hey_other false accepts at 0.5    < 2/32
    clean positive detection at 0.5            >= 55/56
    detection with a command immediately after >= 27/30
    median latency from end of speech          < 120 ms

Two details of the method matter enough to state:

* Clips are padded with a low noise floor, never digital silence. Pure zeros are a
  pathological input to the melspectrogram and shift scores, so `predict_clip`'s own
  zero padding is bypassed (`padding=0`).
* "End of speech" is the last sample above 2% of peak amplitude. Latency is the audio
  offset where the score first crosses the threshold, minus that marker.

Negatives are reported PER CATEGORY, never pooled. The corpus from
generate_negatives.py is adversarial by construction - a fifth of it is
phrase-extending - so a pooled false-accept rate means nothing. Category comes from
the filename prefix (`extend_000_af_bella.wav` -> `extend`).

BOTH TRAINERS ARE SCORED THROUGH THE SAME CODE. `eval/backends.py` picks an
openWakeWord or a microWakeWord backend by inspecting the model, so everything below
is arithmetic over scores. Two consequences worth stating rather than discovering:

* The gates were calibrated on openWakeWord and are reported for either, but a
  microWakeWord score is a sliding-window average with different threshold
  semantics - `--sliding-window-size` is printed with every result for that reason.
  Keep mWW numbers in tuning_mww.md.
* Latency is measured the same way for both and is the one number that transfers
  directly: it is the deployed quantity either way.

Usage:
    python eval_model.py --model my_custom_model/hey_seeree/hey_seeree.onnx
    python eval_model.py --model M --positives my_real_samples/jay
    python eval_model.py --model M --threshold 0.7 --verbose

Needs onnxruntime and an importable openwakeword for .onnx models, plus a TFLite
runtime and pymicro-features for microWakeWord ones. The `eval` compose service has
all of it and runs on the Mac:

    docker compose run --rm eval python eval_model.py --model M
