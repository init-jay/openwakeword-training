Compare trained wake-word models at MATCHED false-accept rates.

This exists because comparing models at a fixed threshold is misleading, and that
mistake cost several wrong conclusions during the tuning documented in tuning.md.
Two runs of an IDENTICAL configuration measured 77% and 67% on held-out run-on
speech at threshold 0.5, and both reached 95% at 8/32 false accepts. What varies
between training runs is largely where the score distribution sits, not how well the
model separates the classes - so a fixed-threshold comparison measures the operating
point rather than the model.

Every comparison here therefore tunes the threshold per model to hit the same
false-accept count, and reports detection at that point. A model is better only if it
detects more at the same precision.

Negatives are read PER CATEGORY, never pooled: the corpus from generate_negatives.py
is adversarial by construction - a fifth of it is phrase-extending - so a pooled rate
is meaningless. `extend` and `hey_other` are the adversarial categories the matched
comparison is keyed on; the rest are ordinary speech and should stay near zero.

MODELS FROM BOTH TRAINERS CAN BE COMPARED HERE, and the matched-false-accept method
is what makes that legitimate. An openWakeWord score and a microWakeWord
sliding-window average are not the same quantity and share no threshold scale - but
"detection at the operating point that admits N adversarial false accepts" is the
same question asked of both, on the same corpus, through the same code. Read the
matched table; the fixed-0.5 table above it is meaningless ACROSS backends as well as
across runs.

Two things travel with a microWakeWord number and are printed with it: the sliding
window size, without which a cutoff means nothing, and the score resolution, because
an int8 output has 256 levels and the sweep goes to 0.01.

Usage:
    python compare_models.py --models my_custom_model/hey_seeree/*.onnx \\
        --positives my_real_samples_holdout/jay \\
        --runon my_real_samples_holdout/jay_runon \\
        --negatives negatives_tts

    # one model, with a threshold sweep for choosing a deployment operating point
    python compare_models.py --models my_custom_model/hey_seeree.tflite --sweep

    # openWakeWord ship candidate against the microWakeWord model, on the Mac
    docker compose run --rm eval python compare_models.py --models \\
        my_custom_model/hey_seeree/hey_seeree_d1bb9f4.onnx \\
        my_custom_model/hey_seeree/mww/tflite_stream_state_internal_quant/stream_state_internal_quant.tflite

Positives MUST be recordings the model has not trained on. train.py trains on
everything under my_real_samples/, so scoring against that directory reports training
accuracy - it overstated detection by ~10 points during this work.

Needs onnxruntime and an importable openwakeword for .onnx, plus a TFLite runtime and
pymicro-features for microWakeWord. The `eval` compose service carries all of it and
builds native on the Mac.
