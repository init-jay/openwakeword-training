"""One streaming interface over the wake-word models this repo produces, running
THE INFERENCE CODE THE DEPLOYMENT TARGET RUNS.

The target is Linux Voice Assistant (OHF-Voice/linux-voice-assistant), which does not
implement inference itself - it depends on two libraries and drives them from
`__main__.py`:

    pymicro-wakeword   MicroWakeWordFeatures + MicroWakeWord   (the ESP32/mWW models)
    pyopen-wakeword    OpenWakeWordFeatures  + OpenWakeWord    (the openWakeWord ones)

Both are used here exactly as LVA uses them, down to the chunk size and the order of
calls. NOTHING IN THIS FILE COMPUTES A SPECTROGRAM, QUANTIZES A TENSOR OR AVERAGES A
SLIDING WINDOW. An earlier version of it did, reimplementing microWakeWord's
`inference.py` from the training repo, and that was wrong twice over: it measured a
pipeline nothing ships, and every detail it got right had to be rediscovered by
experiment. What is left here is clip handling and the arithmetic that turns a stream
of probabilities into an offset in the audio.

    backend = load("my_custom_model/hey_seeree/mww/.../hey_seeree.json")
    scores, offsets = backend.score(pcm_int16)

`offsets[k]` is how many samples of the clip had been fed when `scores[k]` came out -
counted, not derived, by feeding the runtime in its own chunk size and recording the
position each probability appears at. It is the anchor for latency, and it differs
between backends (80 ms chunks for openWakeWord, 10 ms for microWakeWord), which is
why it is returned rather than recomputed by callers from a constant they guessed.


WHAT USING THE DEPLOYMENT RUNTIME SETTLED, that reading the training repo did not:

* THE MANIFEST IS PART OF THE MODEL. `MicroWakeWord.from_config()` takes the JSON, not
  the .tflite, and reads `probability_cutoff` and `sliding_window_size` from it. Score
  the .json and the manifest is under test too; score a bare .tflite and it is not.

* RESETTING BETWEEN CLIPS REQUIRES RELOADING THE MODEL. `MicroWakeWord.reset()` calls
  `close()` and `_load_model()`, with the comment "Need to reload model to reset
  intermediary results". Independently measured here before that was read: an
  interpreter that has `reset_all_variables()` called and its inputs re-zeroed still
  scores one clip 1.00000 the first time and 0.99608 every time after. `OpenWakeWord
  .reset()` only clears a ring buffer, because that model is stateless - the state
  lives in Python.

* THE DEPLOYED PROBABILITY IS NOT THE ONE IN `tflite_streaming_roc.txt`. The training
  repo dequantizes with a hardcoded 1/255 (microwakeword/inference.py); the runtime
  uses the output tensor's own scale, 1/256 here. So a cutoff read off the ROC table
  is about 0.4% off the number the device compares against. Small, but it means the
  ROC file is a guide and this harness is the measurement.

* int8 COARSENS THE SCORES. The output tensor is uint8: 256 levels, 0.0039 apart,
  divided by the sliding window average of 5. Sweeping much below 0.01 measures
  quantization rather than the model. `--model` self-check prints the real resolution.

* "THRESHOLD" IS TWO PARAMETERS for microWakeWord: `probability_cutoff` and
  `sliding_window_size`. Only the first is swept here; the second is fixed per
  comparison and printed with every result, because a cutoff means nothing without it.


THE ONE PLACE THIS DOES NOT USE THE DEPLOYMENT RUNTIME, and why. `pyopen-wakeword` is
TFLite-only, and this repo's openWakeWord ship candidates are `.onnx` - only some runs
were ever converted. `OpenWakeWordOnnxBackend` scores those through
`openwakeword.model.Model`, the path all seventeen runs of tuning.md were measured on.
It is comparability with the notebook, NOT a deployment measurement, and `describe()`
says so on every report. To measure a `.onnx` candidate as it would actually run,
convert it first with `onnx2tflite.py` and score the `.tflite`.
