"""Audio transforms applied to a corpus of WAVs: trimming, and child-range copies.

Moved verbatim from train.py. Both trainers need these for the same reasons:

- Trimming, because BOTH frontends place a fixed-size window relative to the end of
  the array, so trailing silence displaces the phrase and teaches a later alignment.
  The openWakeWord mechanism is documented in trim_silence below; microWakeWord's
  clip duration differs (1500 ms vs 2000 ms) but the failure mode does not.
- Child-range copies, because the corpus is otherwise adult-only. This was the
  largest single win in tuning.md (run 13: a 4-year-old 24% -> 83%).

CAVEAT FOR THE microWakeWord PORT: add_child_range_copies reads the voice's sex from
the Kokoro filename convention (kokoro_af_bella_<uuid> -> "af" -> female). Piper voice
names carry no such marker - en_US-libritts_r-medium with a numeric speaker id says
nothing about sex - so this function will skip every Piper clip rather than
mis-shift it. Making the lever work for Piper needs a sex mapping per voice/speaker,
which is phase 2 work and is listed as an open question in plan.md.

# for the adult, and 34% on his OWN training clips. He was 26% of the real corpus,
# so this is not under-representation: his fundamental sits outside the range of
# almost everything the model has ever seen. Measured medians: ryan 291 Hz, jen
# 269 Hz, jay 153 Hz, Kokoro am_adam 132 Hz, af_bella 227 Hz. openwakeword's own
# PitchShift is +/-3 semitones at p=0.25 against a 13.6-semitone gap, so it cannot
# close it - and it is the same resample-plus-stretch operation as this, just with
# a range a quarter the size (torch_pitch_shift/main.py:156-168).
#
# The ratios are per sex because one global range serves neither. A listening test
# on vtlp_demo/ (run 12): af_bella at 1.28 is the closest thing to ryan in the set,
# while male voices "sound like teenagers up to R1.30 and useless above that
# (chipmunk)". Male voices therefore cover the 152-172 Hz gap between the two real
# speakers rather than reaching a child, which they cannot do without artefact -
# and training on an artefact teaches the artefact.

    ~15 Kokoro male voices already cover far more cheaply than 160 clips of one
    speaker.

    Piper clips participate on equal terms, by carrying the sex in the same
    position: corpus/piper.py names them `piper_p{sex}_...` precisely so the

    female range produces the artefact run 12 warned about, and training on an
    artefact teaches the artefact.

    being shiftable, the child-range lever's COVERAGE shrinks in proportion, and the
