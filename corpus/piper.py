"""Piper sample generation over Wyoming TTS.

microWakeWord generates its positives with Piper, so this is the second engine the
shared corpus layer needs. It is deliberately shaped like the Kokoro path in
train.py - render a phrase at a spread of speeds across a spread of voices, write
16 kHz mono WAVs into a directory - so both trainers can consume either engine's
output, or both at once.

THE SPEED PROBLEM. Wyoming's `synthesize` event carries no rate control, so speed
has to be applied after synthesis. audit_voices.py:191 does it by resampling, which
moves pitch as well as rate - correct there, where the point is to deny the ASR a
comfortable rendering, and wrong here. `PLAIN_SPEEDS = (0.7, 1.6)` in train.py means
DELIVERY RATE: Kokoro's speed parameter re-times the phrase without turning the
speaker into a chipmunk, and the model is meant to learn that the phrase can be
said quickly, not that it can be said by someone with a shorter vocal tract. Pitch
is already covered, separately and on purpose, by add_child_range_copies.

So speed here goes through `time_stretch` (WSOLA, pitch-preserving) instead. Using
resampling would silently entangle the speed sweep with the child-range lever and
make run 13's result impossible to attribute.

PIPER IS STOCHASTIC. VITS samples noise and durations per call, so the same
(voice, speaker, text, speed) renders differently every time - measured in
audit_voices.py, where one speaker scored 0% and then 100% across passes. For a
corpus that is free diversity and needs no special handling. For the audit it is
why `--repeats` exists. It also means the corpus is not reproducible from a seed,
which is already true of the Kokoro path (train.py sets no seed).

EXERCISED AGAINST A LIVE SERVICE. piper_voices enumerated 2005 (voice, speaker)
pairs across en_US/en_GB, and piper_render returns 16 kHz int16 at exact speed
ratios (0.7000, 1.2501, 1.6001 measured on one clip). Not yet used to build a
training corpus - that is --piper-fraction, staged as run 17 in tuning.md.

MEASURE SPEED ON ONE CLIP, NOT ACROSS CALLS. Three separate renderings at 1.0/1.6/0.7
gave 0.964 s / 0.501 s / 1.194 s, which looks wrong and is not: VITS samples
durations per call, so the base clip differs every time. Stretch ratios are only
meaningful against a single rendering.

# Voices that mispronounce the wake word, per wake word. THE PIPER EQUIVALENT OF
# MISPRONOUNCING_VOICES IN corpus/negatives.py, AND IT IS NOT OPTIONAL.
#
# Six of Kokoro's 42 voices say something other than "hey seeree" - ~14% of that
# corpus mislabelled as positives, undetected for eleven runs.
#
# THE EXCLUSION UNIT IS THE SPEAKER, NOT THE MODEL. The expectation going in was the
# opposite: espeak-ng phonemises per model, so every speaker inside one voice gets
# the same phoneme string, and it seemed to follow that they would all pronounce it
# the same. The audit says otherwise - en_US-l2arctic-medium ranges from :ASI at 0%
# to :PNV at 100%. Identical phonemes, different acoustic models, and intelligibility
# varies with the speaker. Keys here are therefore "voice:speaker" wherever the audit
# scored a speaker.
#
# Below is the 2026-09-02 audit of 96 voices against ASR consensus, everything under
# 83% agreement. The transcripts make the distinction clear: excluded voices produce
# a CONSISTENTLY different phrase ("his theory", four renderings running), while the
# ones kept produce "hey siri" with an occasional slip, which is VITS sampling
# durations per call rather than a pronunciation problem.
#
# en_US-l2arctic-medium is a non-native-speaker corpus and 7 of its 12 audited
# speakers land here. That is not automatically a reason to exclude - accented
# renderings of the CORRECT phrase are good training data, since real users have
# accents. It is a reason here because the benefit cannot be measured: there is no
# accented speaker in my_real_samples_holdout/, so the contamination is measurable
# and the upside is not. Revisit if an accented speaker is ever recorded.
#
# WHAT THIS METHOD CANNOT SEE: the score is agreement with the consensus ACROSS
# voices, so an error every voice shares is invisible. Every good voice here
# transcribes as "Hey Siri"; if espeak-ng renders "seeree" as /'sIri/ rather than
# /si:'ri:/, all 96 are uniformly wrong and all 96 score 100%. Check that by ear
# against a real recording, once, per wake word - not from this table.
