# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Local training pipeline for custom OpenWakeWord wake word models. Uses Kokoro TTS for synthetic voice generation combined with real voice recordings to produce `.onnx` models.

## Key Commands

### Docker (recommended)
```bash
docker compose build trainer                  # Build training image
docker compose run --rm trainer ./setup-data.sh  # Download ~17GB training data
docker compose run --rm trainer python train.py --wake-word "hey cal" --data-dir /app/data
```

### Host (mic access needed)
```bash
python record_samples.py --wake-word "hey cal"                  # Record voice samples
python check_alignment.py my_real_samples/ --verbose            # Inspect sample timing
python test_model.py --list-devices                             # List microphones
python test_model.py --model my_custom_model/hey_cal.onnx       # Test model
```

### Manual (no Docker)
```bash
./setup.sh                                    # One-time setup (downloads ~17GB)
source venv/bin/activate
python train.py --wake-word "hey cal"
```

## Architecture

**Docker container** handles training (the dependency-heavy part):
- `train.py` orchestrates the full pipeline
- Generates positive/negative WAV samples via Kokoro TTS API (67 English voices, speed 0.7-1.3x)
- Copies real voice recordings from mounted `my_real_samples/` (3x weighted)
- Creates `training_config.yaml` from OpenWakeWord's template
- Shells out to `openwakeword/openwakeword/train.py --augment_clips` then `--train_model`
- Outputs `.onnx` model to mounted `my_custom_model/`

**Host** handles mic-dependent tasks:
- `record_samples.py` - records real voice samples (PyAudio)
- `test_model.py` - live mic testing of trained models (streams raw PCM from ffmpeg's avfoundation input; no PyAudio)
- `check_alignment.py` - reports where speech sits in the detection window

### Docker volume mounts
- `./data` → `/app/data` - 17GB feature files, background audio, impulse responses
- `./my_real_samples` → `/app/my_real_samples` - user voice recordings
- `./my_custom_model` → `/app/my_custom_model` - trained model output

### Kokoro TTS
- Runs as separate Docker service via `docker-compose.yml`
- trainer container connects via `http://kokoro:8880` (set by KOKORO_URL env var)
- train.py also accepts `--kokoro-url` flag

## Important Design Decisions

- **Negatives must be clearly different** from the wake word. Similar-sounding phrases ("hey call", "hey carl") hurt performance. Use only distinct phrases ("hello", "alexa", "hey siri").
- All audio is 16kHz, 16-bit, mono WAV.
- Real voice samples are copied 3x to weight them higher in training.
- **`my_real_samples/` is searched recursively**, so speakers can live in per-speaker subdirectories (`my_real_samples/jay/`). The relative path is flattened into the destination filename — two speakers recording the same phrase produce identical basenames, so using the basename alone would silently overwrite one speaker's clips with the other's.
- **Silence is trimmed from all samples before augmentation.** OpenWakeWord's `create_fixed_size_clip` (`openwakeword/data.py:719`) aligns the end of the *array* — not the end of the *speech* — with the end of the detection window, so untrimmed silence displaces the phrase. Untrimmed, tight Kokoro clips and fixed 2s recordings land at different offsets and teach contradictory alignments. Negatives are trimmed too, so clip length can't become a class cue. Disable with `--no-trim`.
- **`record_samples.py` cues after a 0.6s mic warm-up.** Cueing before the input device settles loses the first fraction of a second and clips the word onset.
- `--data-dir` flag lets train.py work both inside Docker (`/app/data`) and on host (`.`).
