# ONNX Runtime with CUDA, for feature computation (melspectrogram + embedding).
#
# Must come AFTER openwakeword: its setup.py pins 'onnxruntime>=1.10.0,<2', the
# CPU-only package, which would otherwise be installed over the top. The two are
# separate PyPI packages that both provide the `onnxruntime` module, so the CPU one
# is removed rather than left to win by import order.
#
# 1.19 is the first release whose default PyPI wheels are built against CUDA 12,
# which is what this base image provides. Earlier versions default to CUDA 11.8 and
# would load nothing.
RUN pip uninstall -y onnxruntime \

# onnxruntime-gpu needs cuDNN and cuBLAS, which this base image does not carry - it
# is the -devel variant, not -cudnn-devel. They are already present as the nvidia-*
# wheels that the torch cu121 install pulled in, so point the loader at those rather
# than adding a second copy. Discovered from the installed package rather than
# hardcoded, since the path moves with the Python version.

# Patch: choose the feature-computation device from onnxruntime's own providers.
# Upstream asks torch, so with the CPU build of onnxruntime (which openwakeword's
# setup.py pins) it requests a CUDA provider that does not exist AND sets ncpu=1,
# leaving feature computation single-threaded on CPU - 36 min of an 83 min run.

# Patch: hold the training features in VRAM rather than mmap. The 17.28 GB
# ACAV100M array against 20 GB of RAM leaves training stalling on page faults -
# GPU at 14%, CPU 37% idle, 7.2 GB swapped. Requires `docker compose stop kokoro
# kokoro2` before training so their CUDA contexts are not holding ~2.4 GB.
