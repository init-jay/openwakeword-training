"""
Record real voice samples for wake word training.
Creates 16kHz mono WAV files in the repo's my_real_samples/.

Lives in its own directory with its own uv environment: it runs on the host for
microphone access and needs only numpy, whereas the training environment pins torch
and tensorflow. Keeping them apart means recording does not need the trainer's stack.

Capture goes through ffmpeg's avfoundation input, matching test_model.py, so there
is no PyAudio/PortAudio to build - just `ffmpeg` on PATH.

Usage:
    cd record_real_sample
    uv run record_samples.py --list-devices
    uv run record_samples.py --wake-word "hey cal"
    uv run record_samples.py --wake-word "hey cal" --output-dir ../my_real_samples/jay
