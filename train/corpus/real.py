"""Real voice recordings into a training corpus, weighted by repetition.

Moved from train.py. Two changes, both behaviour-preserving:

- `real_samples_dir` is now a parameter instead of `WORK_DIR / "my_real_samples"`
  read from train.py's module globals, so a second trainer can point at the same
  recordings without importing train.py.
- The `wake_word` parameter is gone. It was never referenced in the body.

    """Copy real voice recordings to training directory, `copies` times each.

    The copies are NOT redundant. They are written before openwakeword's
    augmentation stage, which globs this whole directory, so each copy is augmented
    independently: background noise from `background_paths` at p=0.75, a room
    impulse response, EQ, pitch shift and gain. AddBackgroundNoise runs
    mode="per_batch" and the copies are named real_{i}_... so sorting spreads them
    ~195 apart - every copy lands in a different batch and draws different noise.
    With augmentation_rounds=3 on top, 10 copies means 30 acoustically distinct
    variants of each recording, not 30 identical ones.

    That is why raising this from 3 to 10 in run 10 improved generalisation instead
    of overfitting: held-out run-on detection went 53% -> 77%, the largest single
    effect measured. Real clips are ~4% of the positive set by default and dominate
    the result, because real speech carries room, mic and delivery characteristics
    that Kokoro does not.

    Batch class balance is unaffected (batch_n_per_class fixes that), so this only
    changes how often a real clip is drawn WITHIN the positive class.

    Recordings may sit loose in my_real_samples/ or be grouped one directory per
    speaker (my_real_samples/jay/, my_real_samples/alex/, ...). Both layouts are
    picked up, so speakers can be added, re-recorded, or dropped independently.

    NOTE FOR THE microWakeWord PORT: the repetition trick is specific to a pipeline
    that augments by globbing a directory. microWakeWord generates spectrogram
    features up front, so N identical copies would be N identical feature rows
    rather than N augmented variants - actively worse than one. Weighting there has
    to happen through its own sampling/class weights instead. See plan.md phase 2.
