"""Run a microWakeWord training pass and report where the model landed.

The openWakeWord equivalent is run-training.sh, and this carries over the two
lessons from it that cost the most:

  * WHETHER THE MODEL WAS WRITTEN IS THE REAL SIGNAL, not the exit code. A stale
    model was evaluated twice on the openWakeWord side before identical checksums
    gave it away, so the output is checksummed before and after.
  * AN EMPTY FEATURE SET IS SILENT. microwakeword/data.py logs "No spectrograms
    found in a configured feature set" and carries on, so a corpus that failed to
    build trains a model on nothing and only shows up as a bewildering evaluation.
    The config is checked before training starts.

    python -m mww.train --wake-word "hey seeree" \\
        --ambient data/mww_ambient/speech data/mww_ambient/no_speech

Everything after --  is passed through to microwakeword.model_train_eval.
